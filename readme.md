interactive installation - based on face detection - 
for “rabbitFest”, international animation festival 
(perugia, italy, 19/20th june 2012). 

when a face is detected, a sequence of frames that animates a rabbit is projected on a background image. 
the rabbit can interact with the circumstant space, itself animated.
