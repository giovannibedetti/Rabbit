interactive installation - based on face detection - \
for \'93rabbitFest\'94, international animation festival \
(perugia, italy, 19/20th june 2012). \

when a face is detected, a sequence of frames that animates a rabbit is projected on a background image. \
the rabbit can interact with the circumstant space, itself animated. \
